              <p>As the title states, this blog post has been a long time coming. Too long in fact. I&#8217;ve deliberated over using a blogging service (like Tumblr) or building something from scratch using Rails. Neither choice felt quite right. Hopefully I&#8217;ve struck a decent balance by settling with <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Jekyll is a ruby gem that allows you to write your blog posts in a markdown language of your choice (mine being John Gruber&#8217;s <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a>) and insert those posts into layouts. This seemed like a decent compromise. I get full control over the site (styling, hosting, content control, backup, etc) without having to implement something that has been done hundreds of times before to a much higher standard than I could probably achieve.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I will become dissatisfied with some aspect of this setup at some point in the future, but for now I&#8217;m happy. As a software developer I struggle immensely with prioritisation. Setting up this blog has been a perfect case in point. Sometimes I wonder if I hide my procrastinating ways under the guise of perfectionism.</p>
