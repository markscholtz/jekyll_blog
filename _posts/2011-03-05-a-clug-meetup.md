A CLUG meet up - Future conflict brewing between GNOME and Ubuntu communities
=============================================================================

CLUG, the Cape Linux User Group, meets twice a month at the University of
Cape Town to discuss the latest news affecting the Linux world. I was lucky
enough to attend a presentation given on a topic which is currently being
discussed heatedly amongst people in the know.

### Context: Linux? Ubuntu? GNOME!? ###

Linux is an open source operating system similar to more well known
offerings such as Microsoft's Windows and Apple's Mac OS X. Each of these
offers a unique experience which can be largely attributed to each ones
representation of the desktop environment (the graphical metaphor used by
each operating system to represent a physical desk). For most users of
commercial operating systems such as Windows and OS X there is no option
given when it comes to the desktop environment. There is no choice and you
use what you get. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the beauty of
Linux is that this is not the case. In fact almost the opposite can be said
to be true. You are overwhelmed for choice. This has often been a stumbling
block in the past for Linux's commercial adoption, but recently with the
help of Canonical (a company started by Mark Shuttleworth [TODO: citation
needed]), a recent flavour of Linux called Ubuntu has become extremely popular.

They have done this by making many choices for users that would previously
have had to have been made by the users themselves. This is not to say that
the customisability and power of Linux has been removed, but rather the
whole experience has been made far more approachable for the regular user,
whilst still giving the expert user flexibility and choice. Since moving to
Mac OS X recently myself, I can say that both offer an equally compelling
experience for all spectrums of users, regardless of computer literacy.

One of the major choices that Ubuntu has made in the past is which desktop
environment to present to the user. As far as I am aware, this has
historically always been GNOME (arguably Linux's most popular desktop
environment next to KDE), but recently, Ubuntu have begun to build their own
desktop environment based on GNOME called Unity. This is now the defacto
desktop environment bundled with Ubuntu. This decision was the topic of
contention discussed at the CLUG meetup.

### Ubuntu, I am your father ###

Down in the seminar room of UCT's Chemical Engineering Building, a projector
screen makes its slow ascent into its resting position behind speaker Phil
Bull. There is a palpable anticipation in the air as we await the final few
stragglers. During this time we settle into comfortable seating, some of us
descending into a world of the content being served up by our smartphones,
whilst others discuss the evening ahead. Although Phil's presentation has
yet to begin, decisions are already being made on a location to consume food
and beer afterwards to carry on the conversation. I get the impression that
this is going to be an exciting talk.

Moments later, an attendee rocks up in a Darth Vader mask and takes a seat.
I begin to wonder to myself if this is acceptable attire for CLUG members.
No one pays attention to the new arrival so I guess it is safe to assume
that anything goes. I start to feel quit at home as the geekiness of the
moment starts to envelop me and it is at this point that I'm glad to have
discovered such a group.

The talk begins and Phil Bull, an astrophysics PhD student from the
University of Cambridge, introduces himself. The topic, the widening rift
between the GNOME and Unity projects, is discussed from Phil's perspective
as an open source community member who contributes to both. He is finding it
more difficult to sustain his level of contributions to both projects over
time as the two communities ideologies continue to diverge and seems to be
coming to the sad conclusion that working on both will not be sustainable in
the future.

His presentation is unbiased and non-inflammatory, yet still Phil jokingly
warns us that he is not here to entice a flame war. If I am to be completely
honest I would have to say that this disappoints me.





One of Phil Bull's major concerns is for developers who are now offered a
splintered environment on which to develop as GNOME and Unity continue to
diverge. Phil is a documentation contributor for both projects, which gives
him a unique perspective on just how fractured the communities are becoming
and how hard it is going to be for developers to maintain applications that
work on both platforms.

The tone of the conversation paints a seemingly bleak future for Linux and
the user experience it offers to the end user, not to mention the
difficulties facing developers and other contributors looking to build on
the good work of others. It's fascinating to see that the open source world
is plagued by similar issues to those found in the commercial equivalent.

Phil's talk ends with a well deserved round of applause. He comes across as
an amicable person who is extremely passionate about what he does. He has a
genuine concern about the well being of all parties involved in this latest
open source conflict.

The time to grill the guest speaker arrives, and Phil is posed some
challenging questions. Of most interest to me is to find out which path will
he choose considering he made it clear that he can't work on both projects.
His decision
- GNOME. Sorry Canonical, but you seem to have lost a good man due to what
sounds like a spiteful insistence to split the efforts of the community.
Phil's explanation of Canonical's reasoning of their actions is called
into question. Some in the crowd are unsatisfied that the stated reasons
are all that explain Canonical's seemingly aggressive move.

It is at this point that things really become interesting. The man in the
Darth Vader mask pipes up before Phil has a chance to answer, quipping that
he might be better able to provide satisfactory answers. The Darth Vader
mask is removed to reveal none other than Mark Shuttleworth! My timing in
attending CLUG could not have been better. Or perhaps this is just a day in
the life of a CLUG member, because everyone seems to look suitably
unimpressed.

I should have clicked that something was strange about our Vader. The fancy
shirt, expensive watch and shiny cuff links (along with the olive
complexion) should have been a complete giveaway considering the topic of
discussion. The mask makes sense now. Not wanting to sway the direction of
Phil's talk with his presence, but still wanting to hear the thoughts of the
community, the mask was donned. It occurs to me that Shuttleworth's presence
is almost superhero like under the somewhat surreal circumstances.

Despite the heroic manner in which he appeared, people are not letting
Shuttleworth off lightly. He is being posed some very challenging questions
indeed, but does not miss a beat in answering any of them. The impression I
get from his answers is that they are all personal and not just a
representation of his company's position. He is questioned on many diverse
topics: the legal implications of the software licences that Canonical
employs (which seem to deprive contributors of their right to own the
intellectual property created by their contributions); his opinion on the
split in the community and why it came about; Canonicals apparent lack of
giving back to the community they are only too happy to take from; and many
others.

As I look upon the conversation as a completely neutral observer I notice
the dichotomy that exists between Shuttleworth and his contemporaries. The
personalities in the room could not be more polar in nature. Shuttleworth is
a powerhouse, full of confidence and conviction in what he is doing. His
peers are equally impassioned and intelligent, but Shuttleworth is
domineering. Not in a bad way. He just oozes confidence and belief in his
actions. Despite this observation, however, there does appear to exist an
internal conflict that Shuttleworth is battling. On the one hand he clearly
empathises with the people in the room, but on the other there is a clear
determination to follow through with his actions even though they may appear
to contrast his fundamental beliefs in what open source stands for.

As the debate rages I reflect on how incredibly smart and enthusiastic this
room of people are. Here I am, having fumbled my way into a seminar room at
the tip of Africa, which consists of one of the most influential people in
open source, battling it out against his equally bright and passionate
grassroots contemporaries. Although there are conflicting opinions and
seemingly unresolvable arguments, I feel safe in the knowledge that open
source can only become stronger with people of this calibre involved in its
creation and direction.

Although the debate may not have made perfect sense to me, it was
undoubtedly fascinating. Should you wish to find out more the fist place to
look for commentary would be the CLUG mailing list/website [insert link to
mailing list archive here] where the debate continues. Further information
on the topics discusses at CLUG during this presentation can be found here

happen to live in Cape Town or are just visiting. The members are friendly
and the topics extremely interesting.
