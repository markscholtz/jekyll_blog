title: Buy Quality Software
subtitle: You won’t regret it
---

I just started looking for some wireframing software to help me design
a better user experience for a project I’m working on. I immediately
remembered [Balsamiq][1] after having only ever heard good things about
it and so I navigated over to their website, watched the introductory
video, and read up about the features. Then I saw the price: $80...a
fairly steep price tag for a piece of software that I only just realised
I needed and that I might not use very often, but the thing is, I’m
convinced that it’s worth it. Why?

I’ll be honest here and say that I was once a user of pirated
software, but became more begrudging of doing so as I began to
understand the value of what I was using. My evolution as a computer
user is probably a fair approximation of many people’s history with
the device; a kid with a PC running whatever software it came with; a
student with zero budget where the thought of laying out my own money on
hardware was a big enough decision to make me not even think twice about
using pirated software if I needed to; a PC user who had just started to
earn a reasonable income; and now, a working professional dependent on
using a computer on a daily basis.

This evolution has allowed me to come to the realisation that buying
quality software is an absolute pleasure. My previous modus operandi
when looking for software for a specific task was to spend several hours
(or even days sometimes) researching what was out there only to find
that most of what I had come across \*gasp\* costs money. This research
would inevitably follow a familiar path, starting with me trying to
find the best free version of something that sounded like it might meet
my needs (which was almost never the case), and ending in frustration,
where I eventually just give up and decide not to pursue whatever it was
I had intended to do in the first place. All of this to avoid paying
what sometimes turned out to be a trivial amount of money anyway (how
often have you agonised over a decision to buy a piece of software that
probably only cost the equivalent of a couple of beers and will most
likely come in handy every day, only to not buy it and then blow far
more than that on a night out).

This all started to change for me when I bought my first iPhone. It was
my gateway drug to buying quality software. $1/2 dollar applications
were easily discoverable (most as recommendations from current, happy
users) and provided utility that far outweighed their cost. It was
purchasing these apps that started to warm me to the idea of paying
for quality, something that I inevitably do when purchasing just about
anything else. The intangibility of software sometimes makes it hard to
justify the price, but just stop and think for a minute how much time
you spend using a computer. I’m a developer and so for me it's the
majority of my time almost every day. The higher the amount of time
spent, the higher the cost is of not using quality software.

Switching to using a Mac turned out to be the next logical step on my
journey to becoming a happy software purchaser. The software available
for the Mac ecosystem is, in general, extremely well thought through
and user-centric. Much of it is also lovingly crafted by indie software
developers. The software I have bought so far has been a joy to use and
I feel like a more productive computer user as a consequence, which is
of vital importance to me. When you start using software that works
with you and not against you, you start to experience a new kind of
appreciation for software that accomplishes this.

The message of this post may be perceived as: "in order to buy quality
software, you need to become some kind of Apple fanboy who jumps at the
opportunity to throw money at a problem". That is not my intention at
all. Whichever platform you happen to be on, seek out the opinions of
your peers, take heed of the recommendations made by influential members
of whichever communities you happen to be involved in and follow your
intuition when coming across an "expensive" piece of software that is
loved by it's users. Sometimes the best solution is free (yay open
source) and that's great, but sometimes it isn't. If that is the case,
don't feel rushed into making a purchase, mull it over for a while
and figure out in your own time whether you really need that piece of
software, and when you realise that you do, buy it!
