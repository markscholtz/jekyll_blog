title: Easy on the eyes

Hopefully I am self aware enough to identify many of my faults, but one
that any reader of the first three posts of this site would have been
exposed to would be my somewhat lacking design skills. To resolve this
wrongdoing I have taken inspiration from a colour-scheme that I have
been using for a while now in quite a few of the applications that I use
on a day to day basis (Vim/MacVim, iTerm2 and even OmniFocus) to update
the look of my blog (yes, I know the design is still quite rudimentary,
but I'll get there one day).

The colour-scheme is named
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) by [Ethan
Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/) and has been making quite a few
ripples amongst geeks on the web. I believe it really started spreading
after appearing on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/), but I
could be horribly wrong about that. Anyway, regardless of how it came
to my knowledge, it is really one of the nicest colour-schemes that
I have used for a while. It also comes in a light or dark theme to
suit whatever mood you happen to be in at the time (I'm talking about
Solarized - the colour-scheme in this instance - not this site).

And so after a few months of use I thought why not apply it to this
site to improve its looks somewhat. I think it's an improvement
and I hope you do too. If you spend any amount of time in a
text editor/terminal/IDE, I strongly recommend downloading the
appropriate theme and giving it a try. I'm sure your retinas
will thank you for it. Also check out [the official project on
GitHub](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) if you feel like
porting the colour-scheme to your favourite app and sharing the love.
