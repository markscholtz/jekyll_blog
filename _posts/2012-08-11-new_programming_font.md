I'm currently sitting on a rocking chair, staring out the window at an overcast and drizzly Cape Town winter's day having just gone through the trauma of experiencing a storm with lightening, thunder and even some hail! Actually, the distress continues (this storm is not over), however, it's probably expected behaviour in such situations to be brave and forge on. And forge on I shall, but to calm myself down in this predicament a soothing cup of rooibos tea with honey and a session at the terminal pimping my vim setup is in order.

First a new programming font is required. Why? Because I read about one whilst doing something else and became immediately distracted. No doubt a font was found and installed thanks to [Dan Benjamin's](http://benjamin.org/dan/) [Hivelogic](http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts/) blog. I'm saddened that I can't get hold of Consolas (Dan's number 2 choice) as it was my favourite programming font on Windows, but [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) is great too and a worthy substitute!

Aah that's better. Nerves are definitely feeling less jangly and tender, although what is really needed for blissful, Saturday afternoon, procrastination nirvana is a new vim plugin and I think I stumbled across just the one - [vim-powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/). Vim-powerline provides you with a nicer looking, more functional statusline. If that explanation doesn't get the juices flowing, the [documentation](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/blob/develop/README.rst) on Github certainly will and is where you want to look for more comprehensive details on the plugin's abilities.

Finally I felt like I needed to revisit another plugin - [vim-rails](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails). This one a classic from the legendary Vim plugin creator [Tim Pope](http://tbaggery.com/). I was missing the enhanced project navigation that this plugin enables with just one command :Rtags. With the help of [exuberant ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) this command generates a tags file that Vim uses to allow quick jumping between different aspects of your code base. As an example, hitting ctrl-] with your cursor over a method call will take you to its definition. That is just the iceberg of what this plugin can do, so if you are a Rails developer go and install it and give some of its other features a try.

Alright, I imagine that's probably enough for now as you are once again breathing normally. Possibly the shallow breaths of someone sleeping? If not, you might want to take a closer look at my [Vim configuration](https://github.com/markscholtz/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) which you can find on Github amongst my other dotfiles.

I hope you feel relaxed.
