title: A long time coming
---

As the title states, this blog post has been a long time coming. Too
long in fact. I've deliberated over using a blogging service (like
Tumblr) or building something from scratch using Rails. Neither choice
felt quite right. Hopefully I've struck a decent balance by settling
with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

Jekyll is a ruby gem that allows you to write your blog posts
in a markdown language of your choice (mine being John Gruber's
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and insert
those posts into layouts. This seemed like a decent compromise. I get
full control over the site (styling, hosting, content control, backup,
etc) without having to implement something that has been done hundreds
of times before to a much higher standard than I could probably achieve.

I'm sure I will become dissatisfied with some aspect of this setup at
some point in the future, but for now I'm happy. As a software developer
I struggle immensely with prioritisation. Setting up this blog has been a
perfect case in point. Sometimes I wonder if I hide my procrastinating
ways under the guise of perfectionism.
