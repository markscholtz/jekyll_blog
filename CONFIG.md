# Social Icons

As I don't change these icons that regularly and I don't use Pixelmator that
often these notes should point me in the right direction when trying to modify
my social icons.

The social icons are served up as a sprite generated from the Pixelmator icons
file.

After modification do the following in order to generate the social icons
sprite:

 * Use Image -> Channel Mixer... menu item to get the unhighlighted colour
   right.
 * Use Share -> Export for Web... to generate a png sprite image.
