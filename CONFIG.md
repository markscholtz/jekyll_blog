# Social Icons

As I don't change these icons that regularly and I don't use Pixelmator that
often these notes should point me in the right direction when trying to modify
my social icons.

The social icons are served up as a sprite generated from the Pixelmator icons
file.

After modification do the following in order to generate the social icons
sprite:

 * To modify the unhighlighted icon's colour
   * Open up the Effects Browser (command-3)
   * select "Color Adjustments" from the effects dropdown
   * Drag the "Channels" effect onto the desired layer
 * To generate a png sprite image
   * Use Share -> Export for Web...
