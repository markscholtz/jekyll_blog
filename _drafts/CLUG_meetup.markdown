CLUG meet up - Future conflict brewing between GNOME and Ubuntu communities
===========================================================================

The slow, grating ascent of the projector screen sliding into its
resting position behind speaker Phil Bull inspires awkwardness the
likes of which Ricky Gervais would be proud to have created. There
is a palbable anticipation in the air as we wait for the final few
stragglers to arrive so that Phil can start his talk. During this
time the awkwardness subsides slightly as most of us settle into the
comfortable seating of the seminar room and descend into a world that
consists of just each individual and the content being served up by
our smartphones. This gives me reason to segway to an interesting side
note; the guy in front of me has an iPhone 4 which is getting two bars
of signal (albeit without applying the death grip) to my 3GS's zero bars
down in the cozy resess of UCT's Chemical Engineering Building's Seminar
Room.

The evening ahead is being discussed. Some of the group are heading out
after the talk for food and beer to carry on the conversation (which has
yet to start). Someone rocks up in a Darth Vader mask. I begin to wonder
to myself if this is the modus operandi of the group. I can't help but
smile as the extent of the pure geekiness of the moment starts to sink
in. It is at this point that I'm glad to have discovered a group such
as this. Sadly I have discovered it fairly late, but rather late than
never.

It's quite enjoyable to hunker down here in the back tapping away
quietly on my phone trying to document the moment. I am not feeling to
sociable and that doesn't appear to be an issue at all.

The talk begins and Phil Bull introduces himself. He is an astrophysics
phd student from the University of Cambridge. The talk is fascinating
and consists of Phil's position in the community that sees him torn
between contributing to either GNOME or Ubuntu (as it is no longer
sustainable to do both given the two communities diverging ideologies).
During his talk there are a few joking warnings that the content of his
talk is not meant to entice a flame war (although I'm hoping it does to
some degree).

It seems that a large part of the concern lies with issues with the
developer environment offered by each platform becoming more divergent
and harder to maintain. The contents of the talk so far seem to parallel
other conversations of the moment involving iOS and Android, or further
back, Apple and Windows. The tone of the conversation paints a seemingly
bleak future for Linux and the user experience it offers to the end
user, not to mention the difficulties facing developers and other
contributors looking to build on the good work of others.

It's facinating to see that the open source world is plagued by similar
issues to those found in the commercial world. It's not all long hair,
daisies and tie-died attire.

Phil's talk ends with a well deserved round of applause. He seems like a
really nice guy who is extremely passionate about what he does (in his
spare time mind you) and is extremely concerned about the well being of
all parties involved in this latest open source conflict.

It's question time and Phil is posed some challenging questions, the
most interesting of which is which road will he go down considering
he made it clear that he can't take both. His decision - GNOME. Sorry
Canonical, but you seem to have lost a good man due to what sounds like
a spiteful insistance to split the efforts of the community.

Phil's explanation of Canonical's reasons to do what they did is
questioned. Some in the crowd are unsatisfied that teh stated reasons
are all that explain their seemingly aggressive move.

It is at this point that things really take a turn to the interesting.
The man in the Darth Vader masks pipes up before Phil has a chance to
answer, quiping that he might be more able to provide satisfactory
answers. It's at this point that the Darth Vader mask is removed to
reveal none other than Mark Shuttleworth! I could not have chosen a
better CLUG meeting to attend if I'd tried. Or perhaps this is just a
day in the life of a CLUG member, because everyone is trying to look
very unimpressed.

I should have clicked that something was strange about our Vader. The
fancy shirt, expensive watch and shiny cufflinks (along with the olive
complexsion) should have been a complete giveaway considering the
topic of discussion. The mask now makes sense. Not wanting to sway the
direction of Phil's talk with his presence, but still wanting to hear
the thoughts of the community the mask was donned. Writing that line
triggered a thought in my head that Shuttleworth's presence is almost
superhero like. Here is a man who I feel operates on another level to
the rest of the group, yet is deeply empathising with it's members who I
feel represent Shuttleworth's roots. He clearly is concerned about the
situation and wants to allay the fears of the community. He seems torn
in his position as a huge influencer in the direction of open source,
yet still is someone who was made thanks to his grass roots in the
movement.






People are not letting shuttleworth off easily. Posing some very
challenging questions including why not being happy to give away their
ip to a commercial entity such as canonical.

What an amazingly intelligent and passionate bunch of people who are
involved in opensource.
