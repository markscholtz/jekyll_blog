Buy Quality Software, I promise, you’ll thank me for it

I just started looking for some wireframing software to help me to design a better user experience. I immediately remembered Balsamiq. I have only heard good things about it and so I navigated over to their website, watched the video and read up about the features … and then I was the price: $80. That is a fairly steep price tag for a piece of software that I only just realised that I needed, but the thing is I’m convinced that it is worth it. 

I won’t lie to you, I used to happily use pirated software. My computer using evolution has been roughly; a kid with a PC running whatever software it came with; a student with zero budget where the thought of laying out my own money on hardware was a big enough decision to make me not even think twice about using pirated software if I needed to; a PC user who had just started to earn a reasonable income; a professional software developer and completely satisfied Mac user.

This evolution has allowed me to come to the realisation that buying quality software is an absolute pleasure. My previous MO when looking for software for a specific task was to spend hours/days researching what was out there (even though certain recommendations kept on cropping up), try and find the best free version that sounded like it might meet some of my needs (,but almost always never all) and then use that frustratingly until eventually just giving up and not doing what I intended to do in the first place, rather than coughing up the money for a quality piece of software.

This all started to change with me when I bought my first iPhone. It was my gateway drug to buying quality software. $1 dollar applications that provided utility that far outweighed their cost started to warm me to the idea of paying for quality. I do in every other aspect of my life, but the intangibility of software sometimes makes it hard to justify the price. But then stop and think how much time you spend using a computer (I’m a developer, it the majority of hours of every day). What is the cost of not using quality. 

Anyway to cary on the story of iPhone software purchases, that led me onto paying for extremely useful web services (RTM, pinboard.it). Then I started working for Unboxed Consulting and was introduced to the Mac. Oh how I now love my Mac. I was a mild Apple “fanboy” hater back in my day, but I can’t say enough for how pleasant the user experience is on a Mac. If Windows works for you great, but the best part of using a Mac running OS X is the ecosystem filled with an inordanant amount of quality software built by people with an amazing passion for usability and user experience. 

When you start using software that works with you and not against you, you start to experience a new kind of appreciation for software design. 

There are basically two types of software that I’ll use these days; quality software that I sometimes need to purchase if that’s how the developers earn a living or open source goodness that is just great due to the love and passion put in by people with a serious need for the software that they are helping to build
