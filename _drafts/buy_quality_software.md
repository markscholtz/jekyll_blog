title: Buy Quality Software - you won’t regret it
---

I just started looking for some wireframing software to help me to
design a better user experience for a project I’m working on. I
immediately remembered [Balsamiq][1] after having only ever heard good
things about it and so I navigated over to their website, watched the
introductory video and read up about the features … and then I saw the
price: $80. That is a fairly steep price tag for a piece of software
that I only just realised that I needed and that I might not use that
often, but the thing is, I’m convinced that it’s worth it. Why? Read
on to find out.

I’ll be honest here and say that I used to use pirated software,
but became more begrudging of that fact as I began to understand the
value of what I was using. My evolution as a computer user is probably
a fair approximation of many people’s history with the device; a
kid with a PC running whatever software it came with; a student with
zero budget where the thought of laying out my own money on hardware
was a big enough decision to make me not even think twice about using
pirated software if I needed to; a PC user who had just started to
earn a reasonable income; a working professional, dependent on using
a computer (I currently happen to be a software developer at [Unboxed
Consulting][2]).

This evolution has allowed me to come to the realisation that buying
quality software is an absolute pleasure. My previous modus operandi
when looking for software for a specific task was to spend several hours
(or even days sometimes) researching what was out only to find that most
of what I had found *gasp* costs money. This research would then take
the inevitable path which starts with me trying to find the best free
version of something that sounded like it might meet my needs (which
was almost never the case) and ended in frustration, when I would find
myself eventually just giving up and not doing what I intended to do
in the first place. All of this to avoid paying what sometimes turned
out to be a trivial amount of money anyway (how often have you agonised
over a decision to buy a piece of software that probably only cost the
equivalent of a couple of beers and will most likely come in handy every
day, only to not buy it and then blow far more than that drinking on a
night out).

This all started to change for me when I bought my first iPhone. It was
my gateway drug to buying quality software. $1/2 dollar applications
were easily discoverable (most as recommendations from current, happy
users) and provided utility that far outweighed their cost. It was
purchasing these apps that started to warm me to the idea of paying for
quality - something that I inevitably do when purchasing just about
anything else. The intangibility of software sometimes makes it hard to
justify the price, but then just stop and think for a minute how much
time you spend using a computer. I’m a developer so it is the majority
of hours of every day for me. The higher this number, the higher the
cost is of not using quality.

Switching to using a Mac turned out to be the next logical step to
becoming a happy software purchaser for me. The software available for
the Mac ecosystem is, in general, extremely well thought through and
user centric. Much of it is also lovingly crafted by indie software
developers. The software I have bought so far has been a joy to use and
I feel like a more productive computer user as a consequence, which is
of vital importance to me. When you start using software that works
with you and not against you, you start to experience a new kind of
appreciation for software that accomplishes this.
