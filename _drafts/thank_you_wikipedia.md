At Rubyfuza this year many technical terms were thrown around that I have heard
before, but have just chosen to ignore. DCI, Imperative language, HoFs, etc. I
have probably heard most of these mentioned in some context or another before,
but I have never really taken the time to discover what most of them meant.

This weekend I decided to change that. Wikipedia is brilliant for this sort of
thing and I spent a good few hours drifting from one article to another.
Reading some of these definitions really helped to solidify some of the content
that I had heard at Rubyfuza. Luke Randall's talk on DCI and Aslam Khan's talk
on writing his own language using CoffeeScript were two of the motivators to
learn to better understand what most people were talking about over the
weekend.

A spin off from my investigations is that I finally figured out the difference
between an imperative and a declaritive language. I like learning by contrasts.
It helps me to put things into perspective. And so in order to better
understand certain design patters in OOP I have been inspired to pick up a bit
of functional programming (the pure kind) by giving Haskell a go.
